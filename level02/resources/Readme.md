# Level02

### Tools
tcpdump


### How to solve it

1. After loging in using ssh in level02@(vmIP): 
```
ssh level02@000.000.000.000 -p 4242
```
2. We use the ls command and it shows a pcap file called level02.
```
level02.pcap
```
3. Then we have to try to check whats inside it we use tcpdump and get some ips communications.
```
tcpdump -r level02.pcap 
```
4. It doesnt give us the info we need, so we need to track the whole file using wire shark so we copy it to our machine.
```
sudo scp -P 4242 level02@000.000.000.000:level02.pcap .
```
5. The we open the wireshark program and click with right mouse button and go to Follow->TCP Stream and there we see:
```
ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L
```
6. We try this as password and it doesnt work, the dot(.)is actually non-printable char, if we convert it to hexadecimal we get 7f, that is 127 in decimal and DEL in ASCII.
```
ft_waNDReL0L
```
6. Now we use this password and Voil√° :
```
kooda2puivaav1idi4f57q8iq
```
### How to protect
 - If you use wireshark for your reports avoid saving the reports with sensitive information.
 - If you work in a place and they might be using wireshark in this company, this is the company problem not yours.
